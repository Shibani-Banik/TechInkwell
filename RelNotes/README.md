<h1>Known Issue: Protected Files Folders Are Not Showing in Detailed Migration Report for Specific Locales.
</h1>
<h2>Expected Behavior:</h2>
<p>When running Dell Migrate, Protected Files are not transferred.
Protected Files are commonly system files that should not be transferred or manipulated. These files typically have extensions such as .dll, .exe, .ocx, and .sys. It is generally appropriate to skip these files as they may cause compatibility issues on your new PC.
Once the migration is complete, customers will see these skipped Protected Files in the Detailed Migration Report in the Skipped Files list.
